# Party on, Garth!

This theme was originally based on *[Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)*

Other than the original layout, and javascript, and a few source files /
libraries, it's been totally gutted and re-written for fast flexible Jekyll.

## Improvements & Changes  

- Added Gemfile to ensure github pages compatibility
- Added .editorconfig to standardize code contributions
- Added .gitignore
- Added config.yml based on [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), plus many improvements
- Added svg-icons.html include from [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
- Jekyll-fied the theme to take advantage of Liquid theming capabilities
- Added a _posts, _layouts, _includes, _scss folders
- Componentized layouts with includes
- Componentized configuration allowing for easy overrides and defaults
- Changed to SCSS (instead of LESS)
- Converted theme color to variables in SCSS
- Added 404 page, also from [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
