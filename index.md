## How to Add or Change Content

All content posts go into the _posts/ folder.  Out of the box, {{ site.name }} is configured to use markdown or html.  Posts are ordered based on the date in the filename, with newest date on top.  Jekyll can be further customized using the Gemfile in root folder (or even within the _config.yml file), but keep in mind Github only supports a subset of gems.
